  Jerry is a guy who lived in the "Googooland" and his dream is to become the
best hunter in there. Googooland is a special world which have many monster.
Hunters need to hunt those monsters in order to survive in the world. At his 
childhood, he showed his talent on hunting and was praised by other hunters.
However, he is always unfortunate on hunting because he always cannot find the
monster king and prove his skills.
  On another usual day, Jerry went to consult the village oracle Iris. Expecting
to hear from her that his hunt will be as ordinary as they have always been and
that the monster king will be out of his reach yet again, Jerry was floored
after hearing from her that today will be the day he encounters the monster
king. Giddy with excitement from the oracle's words, he thanked Iris profusely
and rushed home to prepare for the hunt of his dreams. In the back of his head,
he had doubts of the oracle's prophecy, but if there was any chance was better
than no chance to hunt the monster king and prove his worth. As he gathered
his medicines, inspected his tools, and outfitted himself in his most protective
armor, Jerry heard a familiar voice hailing him. It was his old friend Bruce.
