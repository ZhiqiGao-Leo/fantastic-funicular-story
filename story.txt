  Jerry is a guy who lived in the "Googooland" and his dream is to become the
best hunter in there. Googooland is a special world which have many monster.
Hunters need to hunt those monsters in order to survive in the world. At his 
childhood, he showed his talent on hunting and was praised by other hunters.
However, he is always unfortunate on hunting because he always cannot find the
monster king and prove his skills.
  On another usual day, Jerry went to consult the village oracle Iris. Expecting
to hear from her that his hunt will be as ordinary as they have always been and
that the monster king will be out of his reach yet again, Jerry was floored
after hearing from her that today will be the day he encounters the monster
king. Giddy with excitement from the oracle's words, he thanked Iris profusely
and rushed home to prepare for the hunt of his dreams. In the back of his head,
he had doubts of the oracle's prophecy, but if there was any chance was better
than no chance to hunt the monster king and prove his worth. As he gathered
his medicines, inspected his tools, and outfitted himself in his most protective
armor, Jerry heard a familiar voice hailing him. It was his old friend Bruce.
  "Oh great..." Jerry thought, remembering how much Bruce always wanted to tag along on his hunting trips, even though he always ended up scaring the monsters away before Jerry could trap and kill them. Bruce noticed that Jerry was preparing for a hunting trip and immediately asked to come with. Jerry, being a nice guy, knew that he had to let Bruce tag along but was not happy about it. What if he really did meet the monster king but Bruce ruined everything? Jerry knew he had to work extra hard today in order to prevent that from happening. Jerry and Bruce left town and started searching the forest for signs of nearby monsters. Jerry was light on his feet, not making a sound with each step he took. However, it didn't really matter because Bruce was trailing behind him, stepping on every little twig and making lots of noise. After hours of wandering and not finding anything, Jerry was getting frustrated. He kept hearing Bruce stumbling behind him and eventually he snapped. "BE QUIET!" he yelled at Bruce while turning around to look at him. However, when he turned his old friend Bruce was no longer behind him. Instead he was being followed by the monster king.
